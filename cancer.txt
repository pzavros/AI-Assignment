- Missing Values x 
- Duplicate values x
- Outliers OR Visualization

Visualization Lab 2
- Visualization in 2D OR Dimensionality reduction LAB -> se 2 dimensions (PCA)
- Outliers will be visible due to visualization
- NO OUTLIERS DUE TO ERROR HANDLING
- Scatterplots -> 2 Variables continuous and continuous
- Histogram -> different variations
- Bar charts -> categorical and continuous

Data preprocessing
- Encoding which fetures are categorical, LAB NO. 3
- Which attributes are categorial and not ordinal? -> Categorical -> encoding
- Feature Scaling, all numerical data has to be homogeneous
- FEATURE SCALING NOT ON COLUMNS THAT WERE ENCODED - slicing

Classification
Lab 4 / Session 4 / Evaluation METRICS
- Random Forest
- Decision Trees
- SVMs, Linear Kernel -> Polynomial -> Quadratic
- Naive Bayesian
- Neural networks
- Logistic regression
- Changing hyperparameters is new algorithm

- 80 training 20 testing OR k-fold cross validation OR regularisation, OVERFEED LAB / LECTURE

Same steps new dataset
- Pkianoume ta idia apotelesmata???
- Pkioi doulefkoun pkioi oi, doulefkoun me alla hyper parameters?
- WHY??
- DATASET: Other type of cancer AND/OR same cancer
- Because they have different features -> alogorithms work better with different features
FEATURE SELECTION LAB, for example NAIVE BAYESIAN might only work with specific features, i.e. more important features
- Association rules learning only categorical variables (OPTIONAL)

- Conclusion
